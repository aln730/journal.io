Welcome to the Journal Website Project. With three HTML files and
one CSS file, I have created a journal website.While you won't be able 
to edit the content, you will have the opportunity to explore and engage with the
rich narratives shared. I have combined the simplicity of HTML and the aesthetics of CSS to
present these stories in an engaging and user-friendly manner.
